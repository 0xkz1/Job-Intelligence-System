# Job Intelligence System

**An end-to-end job search pipeline** — scrape hundreds of listings, score them against your profile with an LLM, and auto-generate tailored CVs and cover letters for every match. Cheap cloud models do the heavy batches; a local Ollama model is always there as the final fallback.

```python
# One command runs the full pipeline
python run.py --site all

# → Scrape  → Save to 00_saved/ staging → Analyze → Match → Generate CV/CL
#    500+ jobs   stored as raw JSON          LLM      5-axis   tailored per job

# Re-analyze from staging only (skip scraping, use cached raw data)
python run.py --from-saved

# Manual saved jobs (LinkedIn bookmarks + Indeed saved)
python run.py --saved
```

---

## Why This Exists

Job hunting is a numbers game, but manual tailoring doesn't scale. This pipeline:

1. **Scrapes** five sites — Indeed UK, LinkedIn, Reed, Guardian Jobs, Adzuna — plus manual intake (`url-list.md`, watched-list, saved bookmarks)
2. **Analyzes** each job with an LLM — salary parsing, skill extraction, title-only seniority classification
3. **Matches** each job against your profile using 5-axis weighted scoring (skills, experience, location, salary, context/ethos)
4. **Generates** a tailored CV and cover letter for every job scoring ≥ 50%
5. **Outputs** Obsidian-ready Markdown with YAML frontmatter (incl. `categories`) — queryable via Dataview, operated via a Streamlit UI

All LLM calls go through one provider chain — **Mistral (cloud, primary) → StepFun step-3.5-flash (cloud, fallback) → Ollama Gemma-4 (local, last resort on an RTX 5080)** — so batches are fast and cheap, and the pipeline keeps working offline. Job text and your persona are sent to the cloud providers; switch `ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=ollama` for a fully local run. See [2-Tier LLM Strategy](#2-tier-llm-strategy) below.

## Architecture

![System architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

**Flow in one line:** five Playwright scrapers + manual intake → `00_saved/` staging (auto-ingested every run) → `run.py` pipeline (`analyzer` → `filter` → `matcher` → generators) → `_analyzed.json` incremental DB → `10_output/` Markdown → read in **Obsidian**, operated from **Streamlit**.

Every LLM task (skill extraction, context/ethos scoring, EN+JA summaries, CV & cover-letter drafting) goes through `llm_client.py`, which walks the provider chain **Mistral → StepFun → local Ollama** on rate limits, 5xx errors, timeouts, or missing API keys.

---

## Match Scoring

Each job is scored on five weighted axes:

| Axis         | Default Weight | Method                                           |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Skills**   | 40%             | Word-boundary keyword + synonym mapping + TF-IDF name similarity |
| **Experience** | 25%           | Seniority level matching (entry/mid/senior/director) |
| **Location** | 10%             | City match + remote-friendliness bonus            |
| **Salary**   | 5%              | Salary range vs. minimum expectation              |
| **Context**  | 20%             | Brand & ethos alignment (profile, ethos, about) via TF-IDF max-similarity |

Weights are **adjustable in real-time** via the Streamlit UI — no code changes needed.

### Tier System

| Tier | Score Range | Icon | CV/CL Generated? |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Strong | 80%+ | 🟢 | ✅ Yes |
| Good | 60–79% | 🟡 | ✅ Yes |
| Partial | 40–59% | 🟠 | ✅ If ≥ 50% threshold |
| Weak | < 40% | 🔴 | ❌ No |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# 2. Configure LLM providers in .env (any subset works; the chain skips missing keys)
#    MISTRAL_API_KEY=...          primary (cloud)
#    STEPFUN_API_KEY=...          fallback (cloud)
#    FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=stepfun,ollama
#    Local last resort: install Ollama and pull the model set in OLLAMA_MODEL
#    (default: gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-gguf)

# 3. Configure search
#    Edit config.yaml — keywords, locations, salary, sites

# 4. Run full pipeline
python run.py                    # Scrape + analyze + match + generate
python run.py --reanalyze        # Re-score only (no scraping)

# 5. Launch UI (optional)
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

### Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
keywords:
  - Creative Technologist
  - Technical Artist
  - Web Developer

locations:
  - Edinburgh
  - Glasgow
  - Remote

min_salary_gbp: 26000
match_score_threshold: 0.50    # Generate CV/CL only for ≥ 50% match

sites:
  - indeed
  - linkedin
```

### Data Flow

The pipeline runs in four modes depending on the start point:

| Mode | Command | Path | Use Case |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| **Full scrape** | `run.py --site all` | scrape → `00_saved/` → analyze → `10_output/` | Nightly cron |
| **Staging reanalyze** | `run.py --from-saved` | `00_saved/` → analyze → `10_output/` | Rerun after matcher changes |
| **Manual saved** | `run.py --saved` | `scraper_saved.py` → `00_saved/` → merge → analyze → `10_output/` | Process bookmarks |
| **URL List Scrape** | `scraper_url_list.py` | `00_saved/url-list.md` → Playwright+Ollama → `url_list_jobs.json` | Paste public job links to scrape |
| **Watched Match** | `watched_matcher.py` | `00_saved/watched-list/*.md` → analyze → reports appended back | Fallback: Copy-paste raw text/emails |

### Manual Job Inputs (Watched vs. URL List)

To analyze jobs that weren't captured by the automated scrapers, you can use two pathways in `00_saved/`:

1. **URL List (`00_saved/url-list.md`)** [Recommended for Web links]
   - **How**: Simply paste any job page URL (Indeed, LinkedIn, or any career page) into this markdown list.
   - **Mechanism**: `scraper_url_list.py` uses Playwright to open the page, extracts the text, and uses Ollama to structure it. No manual formatting required.

2. **Watched List (`00_saved/watched-list/`)** [Fallback for raw text]
   - **How**: Create a `.md` file (e.g., `Company_Role.md`), write `# Job Title` on the first line, and paste the raw description text below it.
   - **Mechanism**: `watched_matcher.py` matches it directly. Useful for offline PDFs, emails, or job descriptions behind strict corporate login walls that cannot be easily scraped.

```

### Obsidian Dataview Integration

All match reports carry `source`, `type`, `saved_at`, and scoring fields — queryable live in Obsidian:

```dataview
TABLE match_score_pct, source, saved_at
FROM "career/Job-Intelligence-System/10_output/00_matches"
WHERE source = "indeed"
SORT match_score_pct DESC
```

```dataview
TABLE count() AS Count
FROM "career/Job-Intelligence-System/10_output/00_matches"
GROUP BY source
```

```dataview
TABLE round(avg(match_score_pct), 1) AS "Avg Score"
FROM "career/Job-Intelligence-System/10_output/00_matches"
GROUP BY type
```

### Frontmatter Reference

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `source` | `indeed` / `linkedin` / `manual` | Where the job came from |
| `type` | `auto` / `manual` | How it was captured |
| `saved_at` | `2026-07-11` | Date added to the system |
| `match_score_pct` | 0–100 | Overall match score |
| `tier` | `Strong` / `Good` / `Partial` / `Weak` | Tier label |
| `skills_score` | 0–100 | Skill embedding similarity |
| `experience_score` | 0–100 | Seniority level |
| `location_score` | 0–100 | City + remote match |
| `salary_score` | 0–100 | Salary vs minimum |
| `context_score` | 0–100 | Brand/ethos alignment (LLM) |

---

## Real Results

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Jobs scraped per run | ~507 |
| Match reports generated | 481 |
| Tailored CVs generated | 297 |
| Tailored cover letters generated | 297 |
| Cost per run | £0 (all local LLM) |
| Hardware | RTX 5080, Ubuntu, Ollama |
| Scoring latency | ~0.5s per job (Ollama inference) |

---

## Cron Scheduling

Two-stage nightly pipeline:

```bash
# Every night at 02:00 — scrape new jobs + reanalyze
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/Job-Intelligence-System && python3 scraper_saved.py && python3 run.py --site indeed --pages 5
```

What happens each night:
1. `scraper_saved.py` — scrapes LinkedIn bookmarks + tracker → `00_saved/_saved_index.json`
2. `run.py --site indeed` — scrapes Indeed, saves raw → `00_saved/_raw_indeed_*.json`, then analyzes → `10_output/`
3. Both manual saved + auto scraped jobs are merged before analysis (deduplicated by URL)

For ad-hoc reanalysis without re-scraping:
```bash
cd /path/to/Job-Intelligence-System && python3 run.py --from-saved
```

---

## Philosophy

- **Local-first** — no API keys, no cloud costs, no rate limits
- **Privacy-aware** — run fully local with `ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=ollama`; the default cloud chain sends job text + persona to Mistral/StepFun (no free-tier providers that train on prompts)
- **Composable** — each stage is a standalone module; swap any part
- **Observable** — every output is human-readable Markdown with structured metadata

---

## Future Enhancements

- [x] ~~Multi-language support (JP/EN job markets)~~ *(frontmatter + source 対応済み)*
- [ ] Company research enrichment (Glassdoor, companies house)
- [x] ~~Application status tracking via Obsidian Dataview~~ *(source/type/saved_at でクエリ可能)*
- [x] ~~PDF export for CVs and cover letters~~ *(20_pdfs/ ディレクトリ + コマンド)*
- [ ] Streaming LLM generation (view CV as it's written)
- [ ] 00_saved/ → 00_matches/ stage-gating threshold per source

## System Evolution Log

A running record of non-obvious decisions, bugs, and design pivots — written for both humans and AI agents picking up this project.

### 2026-07-12 / 2026-07-13 — AI-Assisted Refactor Session

#### Obsidian Cross-linking (CV / CL / Match Report)

**Goal**: Make the three generated documents (match report, CV, cover letter) mutually discoverable in Obsidian via YAML frontmatter and wikilinks.

**Approach**:
- All three files now contain `cv:`, `cover_letter:`, and `match_report:` properties in frontmatter pointing at each other by bare filename (no extension, no path) — standard Obsidian wikilink resolution.
- `run.py` pre-calculates all three filenames before calling any generator, so each file can reference the others without post-processing.
- Match report body uses `[[Filename]]` wikilink syntax (not relative markdown links) for the Related Documents section.

#### Skill Matching — Boundary Bug

**Problem**: Short skill keywords (`c`, `go`, `hr`, `lab`) were matching inside longer unrelated words (`collaborative`, `laboratory`, `labor`). This caused false positives in `_compute_skill_scores()` in `matcher.py`.

**Fix**: Replaced bare `in` substring checks with `re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(kw) + r'\b', text)` for all skill keyword lookups. Single-char keywords (≤1 char) are skipped entirely to prevent noise.

#### Skill Synonyms + Level Mapping (Prototyping / Agile)

**Problem**: Keywords like `scrum`, `kanban`, `sprint planning` appeared in job descriptions and Kazuki's profile, but weren't mapping to any scored skill because the canonical names (`Agile`, `Prototyping`) weren't in `SKILL_SYNONYMS`.

**Fix**:
- Added `Prototyping` (Advanced, 0.9) and `Agile` (Intermediate, 0.6) to `skills.md`.
- Added synonym mappings in `matcher.py` `SKILL_SYNONYMS`:
  - `scrum`, `kanban`, `sprint`, `sprint planning`, `rapid prototyping` → `prototyping`
  - `agile methodology`, `agile development`, `scrum master` → `agile`
- Result: Wordsmith AI product designer match score went from ~60% to **82% (Strong Match)**.

#### Email Address Bug

**Problem**: `cv_generator.py` and `cover_letter_generator.py` had an old email (`junoyuno55@gmail.com`) hardcoded, despite `contact.md` and `contact_ja.md` already having the correct address (`kazukiyunome@gmail.com`).

**Fix**:
- Updated both generator templates.
- Batch-replaced all existing generated `.md` files in `10_output/` with `sed`.

#### `UnboundLocalError` in `run.py` — Import Shadowing

**Problem**: A local `from analyzer import analyze_job` statement inside `main()` was added at some point for the `--reanalyze` branch. Python's scoping rules treated `analyze_job` as a local variable for the *entire* function, causing `UnboundLocalError` in code paths that didn't reach that branch.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate local import. The global-level `from analyzer import analyze_job` at the top of `run.py` is sufficient for all code paths.

#### Key Design Decision — Prototyping vs Agile as Separate Skills

Kazuki identified that **Prototyping** and **Agile** are genuinely separate competencies in his profile, not synonyms of each other. Prototyping is a core creative/technical practice (physical + digital); Agile is a process methodology he uses but doesn't specialize in. This is why they have different proficiency levels (Advanced vs Intermediate) in `skills.md`.

## 2-Tier LLM Strategy (2026-07-15)

### Background

The pipeline originally used **Ollama (Gemma-4-26b)** exclusively for all LLM tasks: skill extraction, context/ethos scoring, CV generation, and job summaries. This worked but was **slow** — each Ollama call took 30-120 seconds, making full pipeline runs take hours. Batch operations (e.g. generating CVs for 140 jobs) could take 3-4 hours.

### Core Idea: Lightweight Cloud LLM First, Local Heavy LLM as Fallback

For lightweight, high-volume tasks (CV generation, batch scoring), use a **cheap cloud LLM** as the primary provider. Only fall back to the **local heavy model (Ollama)** when the cloud API fails (rate limits, timeouts, 5xx errors). This cuts batch processing time from hours to minutes at trivial cost (~¥900 for 140 CVs).

The cloud provider is **interchangeable** — any cheap, fast API (Mistral Tiny, GPT-4o mini, Gemini Flash, etc.) works. The strategy is provider-agnostic.

**Architecture:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                llm_client.py                      │
│         (Unified LLM client with fallback)        │
│                                                  │
│  ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=<cloud>   (primary, cheap)    │
│  CLOUD_MODEL=<lightweight model>                  │
│  FALLBACK_PROVIDER=ollama   (auto on 429/5xx)    │
│                                                  │
│  All LLM calls go through call_llm():            │
│  - _ollama_context_score()  -> context/ethos     │
│  - _ollama_job_summary()     -> bilingual summary │
│  - _generate_experience_ollama() -> CV experience │
│                                                  │
│  If cloud returns 429/5xx/timeout:                │
│  -> Auto-retry on Ollama (gemma-4-26b)           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**.env configuration (provider-agnostic):**

```bash
ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=mistral          # or openrouter, openai, etc.
CLOUD_MODEL=mistral-tiny           # any lightweight, cheap model
FALLBACK_PROVIDER=ollama
MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your-api-key>     # provider-specific key
```

**Code changes:**

1. **matcher.py** — `analyze_match()` gained `skip_summary=True` parameter. In `--reanalyze` mode, this skips per-job LLM summary generation. This reduces 295 jobs × ~5s/job = ~25 minutes of API calls to zero during batch matching.

2. **run.py** — `--reanalyze` path now calls `analyze_match(job, config, skip_summary=True)`.

3. **llm_client.py** — Unified LLM client (already existed, documented here). Routes to any cloud provider / Ollama based on env vars. Auto-fallback on transient errors (429, 5xx, timeout).

4. **cover_letter_generator.py** — Template-based, no LLM needed. Instant.

### Performance Results (2026-07-15)

| Metric | Ollama Only | Lightweight Cloud |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| CV generation (1 job) | ~60-120s | ~3-5s |
| 140 CVs + 140 CLs batch | ~3-4 hours | **~8 minutes** |
| Cloud rate limit hits | N/A (local) | 0 |
| Ollama fallback triggered | N/A | 0 times |
| API cost | free | ~900 JPY (~5 GBP) |

*(Benchmarked with Mistral Tiny; other lightweight models should give similar results.)*

### Key Lessons

1. **Use the cheapest cloud tier for batch tasks**: Lightweight models (e.g. Mistral Tiny) have significantly more generous rate limits than mid-tier models (e.g. Mistral Small Latest). For batch CV/CL generation where quality bar is "good enough", the cheapest tier is the right choice. Mid-tier throttles quickly and is better for single-shot high-quality tasks.

2. **`skip_summary` optimization**: `analyze_match()` was calling `_ollama_job_summary()` for every job scoring ≥0.50, even during batch re-analysis where existing summaries could be reused. The `skip_summary` flag cuts this to zero in batch mode.

3. **Context score caching**: `analyze_match()` correctly detects and reuses cached LLM context scores (`job.match.context.score`), avoiding redundant LLM calls.

4. **Cover letters are template-based**: `cover_letter_generator.py` uses role-type templates (no LLM), so generating 140 cover letters is near-instant. Only CV experience section needs LLM.

5. **Fallback never triggered**: The Ollama fallback was configured but never activated. The cloud model handled the entire batch without a single rate limit or timeout — but the fallback is there as a safety net.
