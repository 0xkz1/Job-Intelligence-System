VERIFIED RECORD (the ONLY things this candidate has actually done):
{facts}

PARAGRAPH:
{text}

Report a problem ONLY for FABRICATION: a claim about the candidate's own past work that
is absent from the verified record.

The candidate's record is made of SELF-DIRECTED projects plus a short employment history.
So the test is not "was this self-directed?" — it is "does the record show this work, and
does the paragraph describe WHO it was done for correctly?"

REPORT these:
- A named project/system that is not in the record, or that the record shows doing
  something different from what the paragraph claims.
- Work attributed to a CLIENT, EMPLOYER, or PLATFORM the record does not show. Both
  "I designed brand identities for <employer>" and "during my work at <employer>" are
  fabrication unless the record lists that employer. Reframing the candidate's own
  machine, vault, or plugin as something delivered for someone else is fabrication too.
- Named clients, employers, industries, or scale figures absent from the record.
- An asserted FIELD, DISCIPLINE, or DOMAIN of past work the record does not show —
  "my work in packaging design", "my background in motion graphics", "years spent in
  editorial design". Vague phrasing is not a licence.
- A real project bent to a BENEFICIARY or PURPOSE the record does not show. The record's
  knowledge system is the candidate's own; "I built a knowledge infrastructure for pupils"
  is fabrication because the record shows no pupils. Same for "pipelines for hospital
  staff", "a workflow for retail teams". Check who the record says the work served, and
  report any paragraph that hands it to someone else — the resemblance of the underlying
  system does not license the new audience.

Do NOT report these:
- Naming one of the candidate's OWN documented projects and describing what it does, as
  the record describes it, with no client attached. "In developing the AI Job Scout
  System, I designed a multi-agent workflow" is honest and correct.
- Describing what the EMPLOYER does, or addressing the employer as "you"/"your".
- Describing HOW the candidate works — their approach, principles, or interests.

The decisive question for any piece of past work: does the record contain it, and does
the paragraph claim it was done for someone the record does not name?

THE JOB:
Company: {company}
Title: {job_title}
Posting (excerpt): {job_description[:2000]}

THE CANDIDATE (ethos = the backbone of the whole letter):
{persona[:8000]}

THE CANDIDATE'S REAL PROJECTS (the only concrete work you may cite — pick ONE):
{projects_digest}

HOW TO WRITE THIS OPENING (follow in order):
1. Read the posting and decide which ONE of the candidate's ethos principles it most resonates with — e.g. "Building Tools That Amplify Human Creativity", "Craft × Structure", "Reduce Friction Between Idea and Execution", or "Knowledge as Infrastructure". Different jobs should surface different principles; do not default to the same one every time.
2. Pick the ONE real project from the list above that best fits this specific role, and name it.
   Choose on what the project IS ("what it is:" line), not on how technical its name sounds.
   A graphic design, branding or illustration post is better served by the illustration,
   identity, 3D or portfolio-site work than by an AI pipeline; a photography post by the
   photography work; an infrastructure or ops post by the node-ops or orchestration work.
   The list holds sixteen projects across design, illustration, photography, web and
   infrastructure — do not keep reaching for the same two or three AI systems.
3. Judge how much this posting actually reveals about the EMPLOYER'S OWN work. Recruitment agencies and thin postings often say nothing about it — in that case you must NOT describe what the employer does, because you would be guessing.
4. Choose the first sentence to fit what you found in step 3:
   - Employer's work is clearly described → you may open from it, then pivot to the candidate.
   - Employer's work is unclear, or the poster is an agency hiring for a client → open from the candidate's own practice or from the concrete demands of the ROLE ITSELF, never from an invented account of the employer.
   Vary the construction. Do not open every letter with "Your work at X … resonates with my approach"; that frame is one option among several, not a formula.
5. Open with that sentence, anchor it to the one named project, and connect both to this posting's actual focus. The result must read as written for THIS job — a reader comparing two of these letters should see different principles, different projects, different opening moves.

RULES:
- First person, UK English, plain prose. No markdown, no bullet points, no heading.
- The candidate is the WRITER, not the reader. Write "I"/"my" for the candidate; "you"/"your" may refer ONLY to the employer. Never describe the candidate's own work as "your work" — that inverts the letter.
- Reference something CONCRETE and specific from this posting (their product, mission, tech stack, or the role's actual focus) and connect it to the candidate's real background.
- Do NOT fabricate experience or qualifications not in the candidate profile.
- NEVER claim the candidate has worked in the employer's industry or sector (finance, healthcare, retail, legal, government, gaming, …) unless the candidate profile explicitly says so. Constructions like "I've built similar systems for financial platforms", "my experience with healthcare clients", or "having worked in retail" are FORBIDDEN unless verbatim supported by the profile above.
- You may describe what the EMPLOYER does in their sector; you may not assert that the candidate has done it too. Connect via the candidate's documented approach and process, not via invented domain experience.
- Do NOT invent a project, client, or deliverable. If you describe a specific piece of past work, it must be one named in the projects list above, described as it is described there. Never reframe the candidate's personal tooling or hardware (their own compute machine, their own vault, their own plugins) as work delivered for someone else.
- Never mention relocation or moving, and never claim the candidate lives in, is near, or is moving to the employer's city. The candidate is based in Edinburgh; the job's location is irrelevant to the opening.
- Ground the connection in the candidate's actual process or outcomes (systems thinking, automation, design rigor) — not literal tools or hardware (tablets, specific input devices, software names) unless the posting explicitly calls for them. Backstage implementation details do not belong in an opening paragraph.
- Avoid recycling the ethos headings verbatim as filler ("reduce friction between idea and execution", "craft and structure", "tools that amplify human creativity"). Express the chosen principle through the specific project and this posting, in your own words.
- No clichés ("I was excited to see", "I am writing to apply", "passionate about"), no flattery filler.
- Do not include the greeting line; the letter template already has "Dear Hiring Team".
